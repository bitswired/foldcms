# Building a Sustainable Tech Future: Why Repairability Matters

Every year, **50 million tons** of electronic waste is generated globally. Most of it could have been repaired instead of replaced. The tech industry is finally starting to change.

## The Problem with Modern Electronics

For years, manufacturers have designed products that are:

- **Glued together** instead of screwed
- **Impossible to open** without specialized tools
- **Serialized components** that reject third-party parts
- **Limited software support** that forces upgrades

This approach has environmental, economic, and ethical consequences that we can no longer ignore.

## Enter the Framework Laptop

The [Framework Laptop 16](/products/framework-laptop-16) represents a radical departure from this model:

> Every single component is designed to be upgraded or replaced by the user. The mainboard, screen, keyboard, portsâ€”everything.

This isn't just about saving money. It's about **ownership** and **sustainability**.

## The Benefits of Modular Design

### Environmental Impact

- **Reduced e-waste**: Replace only what breaks
- **Longer product lifecycles**: Upgrade instead of replace
- **Lower carbon footprint**: Manufacturing new devices is energy-intensive

### Economic Advantages

- **Lower total cost of ownership**
- **Better resale value**
- **No forced obsolescence**

### User Empowerment

- **True ownership** of your device
- **Learning opportunities** through repairs
- **Customization** to your exact needs

## Industry Response

Major manufacturers are starting to take notice:

- **Apple** now offers self-service repair programs
- **Samsung** extended software support to 7 years
- **Fairphone** continues to push the envelope on sustainability

But there's still a long way to go.

## What You Can Do

Support companies that prioritize:

1. **Repairability scores** of 7/10 or higher
2. **Long-term software updates**
3. **Available spare parts**
4. **Repair documentation**

Vote with your wallet. The market will follow.

## The Future is Modular

As right-to-repair legislation gains traction worldwide, we're seeing a shift in how electronics are designed. The next decade will bring:

- **Standardized components** across manufacturers
- **Open repair ecosystems**
- **Circular economy models**
- **Cradle-to-cradle** product design

The **Framework Laptop** is just the beginning. Imagine a world where every device is built to last, easy to repair, and simple to recycle.

That's the future we're building.
